            With a background in English language education, I loved finding
            creative ways to engage students in learning new concepts. Pursuing
            more automated, interactive tools to spice up my lessons inspired me
            to learn more about Technology. I wanted to learn the skills to
            build new and engaging products myself to improve user/learner
            experiences. After completing the Grace Hopper bootcamp, I now work
            as a Software Engineering Teaching Fellow, combining my love of
            teaching and coding. Iâ€™ve become more and more fascinated with the
            possibilities Technology offers to solve complex problems, and am
            eager to launch a career that will allow me to explore the potential
            applications of Technology to improve our world.

            In my free time, I love traveling and learning about the people,
            cultures, and history of the world. I've lived in England, Thailand,
            and Malaysia and have visited 20 other countries. I also love
            reading and playing games!
