                <b>
                  I am a Software Engineer with a background in English language
                  education. While teaching, I loved finding creative ways to
                  engage students in learning new concepts. <br></br>
                  <br></br>While pursuing more automated, interactive tools to
                  bring the concepts I was teaching to life, I was inspired to
                  learn more about Technology. I wanted to learn the skills to
                  build new and engaging products myself to improve user/learner
                  experiences. <br></br>
                  <br></br>After completing the Grace Hopper bootcamp, I became
                  a Software Engineering Teaching Fellow there, combining my
                  love of teaching and coding. Iâ€™ve become more and more
                  fascinated with the possibilities Technology offers to solve
                  complex problems, and am eager to launch a career that will
                  allow me to explore the potential applications of Technology
                  to improve our world.
