                    <li>
                      Solution: Use React's componentDidUpdate lifecycle method
                      in the Timer component to 'listen' for parent component's
                      state changes (such as 'timeUp' or 'started') that
                      indicate whether the timer should restart.

                      the current solution before displaying the hint, resulting

                    <li>
                      Problem: Viro React is incompatible with React Native
                      Navigation, making it impossible to navigate from a
                      'static' screen to a VR screen.

                    <li>
                      Solution: Pressing 'play' triggers a state change in the
                      Redux store that conditionally renders the VR 'space'

                    <li>
                      Solution: Score is updated in Redux with every timer
                      re-render (ie every second). When the user wins the game,
                      a function is triggered that adds the most recent score
                      from the Redux store into the user's 'scores' array in the
                      Firestore database. Storing the user's scores in an array
                      in a NoSQL database makes it simple to display them on the
                      user's profile.
